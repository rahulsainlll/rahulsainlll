More About Me

When I'm not working, you might find me scuba diving :diving_mask: with my messy hair in the ocean around islands of Taiwan. :desert_island:
I'm a fan of different cultures and beautiful nature who used to travel a lot. Now that traveling is not a good idea because of covid-19, why not dive into the ocean and enjoy the amazing marine life? ðŸ¤™ðŸ¤™ðŸ¤™
